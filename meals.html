        Our Feelings, Our Families & Our Food
At Epitome Education, we understand the importance of a balanced diet. We
understand how essential a proper diet and readily available nutrition dense foods
are to the intricate function of the developing brain. We know that a hungry tummy
means a wandering mind. With this in mind, we place a huge priority on creating
meals which cater to the children’s nutritional needs and contain vital nutrients
that will taste delicious, sustain them throughout the day and provide them with
vitamin packed whole foods. These meals are part of the curriculum and help to
build the well-rounded student that is able to make not only smart decisions, solve
problems and overcome challenges, but an individual that makes sound choices
regarding life decisions for health and wellness. As part of our curriculum, the
children participate in cooking event classes that allow them to immerse in the
processes involved in creating the menu items that they are able to enjoy. They will
learn more life skills and explore new and different creative experiences by
working with food. These classes are also available to members at a nominal cost
(register for cooking classes on the website).
We offer a full menu of Breakfast & Lunch, 7 days/week. Menu items are well
thought out and each item is carefully crafted from scratch right here in the
“Epitome Eatery” from scratch daily. Each child receives a made-to-order breakfast
and lunch as well as brain building snacks throughout the day anytime they are
hungry. The children have clean, cold, alkaline water in both lemon and cucumber
flavors available to them in glass drinking vessels the entire day long and certain
meals also come with a beverage when specified (please see calendar). The children
are able to eat in the cafe area, at their tables in the classroom or outdoors at the
alfresco dining and lounge area, surrounding our beautiful fire pit. The children are
given an entire hour to complete their meal and are able to receive assistance with
eating if they need it and will not be left to manage a meal they cannot handle. We
are here to help them learn to do things on their own and we do just that…we help!
We also offer a full coffee bar, a la carte items & even meal plans to parents,
members and family members on the go, refer to the tuition page for plan rates.
Our Offering, your Opting & Ordering
We offer several different meal plans that cater to each individual family's needs.
Each child enrolled in a program receives the meal plan included as part of their
tuition structure because as mentioned this curriculum utilizes the meals,
preparation and planning in building valuable life skills that the children will use for
many years to come, with great hope. As a family member or as an active
homeschool member family, you are able to purchase a la carte meals each day if
you just need something quick and on the go and we also offer weekly or monthly
meal plans where your breakfast/lunch/both will be available for you when you
drop off/pick up or just come to the center to use the resources. We also offer a
full family meal plan where parents and members are able to get a full meal for a
family of 4 for the evening when they stop by and pick up their reserved orders
with the meal plan. This service is just for our families so that working parents and
busy homeschool parents can have the nutritious and delicious scratch made
meals they deserve. What we eat makes a world of difference in our mindset, focus,
outlook and stature. A better me and a better you makes a better us.
You are able to order by text when dropping off your child, you are able to order in
person when you arrive at the center (preparation time will vary) and you are also
able to sign up for the weekly and monthly meal plans on the website or when you
register in person at the center. All payments are made online at the website
epitomeeducation.org click make a payment and find the meal plan option that you
are interested in. Once signed up for the meal plan you can either create a set
schedule for meals to be catered or you are able to order on an as needed basis.
The focus of the meal plan is to provide convenient and health conscious foods to
our families who deserve the best but don't always have the time and ensures that
our children always have the best foods available to them.
