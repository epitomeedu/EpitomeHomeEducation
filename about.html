          About Our Founder
        </h3>

        <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
          I’m a single mom, entrepreneur, and educator at heart who believes deeply in the power of
          small, intentional learning communities. Originally from New York, my journey brought me
          to West Texas with one clear goal: to create a better, more balanced life for my child
          while building something meaningful for others.
        </p>

        <div id="founderMore" class="expand leading-relaxed space-y-4">
          <p>
            After years as a chef and bakery owner, I learned firsthand the value of creativity,
            discipline, and learning by doing. As a military widow and an expat who has lived and
            worked across cultures, I’ve seen how essential stability, compassion, and strong
            support systems are—especially for children.
          </p>

          <p>
            When rising costs and limited childcare made it clear that staying in New York was no
            longer sustainable, I chose to start fresh somewhere that allowed room to grow, breathe,
            and build community.
          </p>

          <p>
            Epitome Education was born from that vision—a place where children are known, supported,
            and encouraged to learn with purpose and confidence.
