          About Our Founder
        </h3>

        <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
          A grateful mother of 2 wonderful individuals; a man, aged 24 years and a high spirited, curious, 6 year old boy. 
          I am a lifetime student having earned degrees from several accredited NY State Institutions such as Syracuse University and State University of New York @ StonyBrook. 
          Forever a student first, I am an educator at heart, and have longed for decades to put into place a micro-school that treats each child as an individual with a localized purpose. 
          Since my big son was small I have pined to be the teacher that allows these children FREEDOM from a system that does not serve them or their families. 
          As a longtime entrepreneur who believes deeply in the power of small, intentional communities, I listened to God as He spoke to me about West Texas.  
          Originally from New York, our journey brought us here with one clear goal: to create a better, more balanced life for my child while building something meaningful for others.
        </p>

        <div id="founderMore" class="expand leading-relaxed space-y-4">
          <p>
            After years as a chef, bakery owner and property manager, the list of interests never ends. 
            I love to bake and cook obviously but I am an avid outdoors person, knitter, reader, seamstress, fashionista, 
            woodworker, writer the list will go on forever because there is nothing I don't love. 
            I am beyond thrilled to be able to teach Epitome students every single thing I know 
            and to learn alongside them in an interactive and mutually respective environment. 
            Being an entrepreneur, I learned firsthand the value of creativity, discipline, and, 
            especially, failing forward. Life has also taught me resilience. As a military widow and 
            an expat who has lived and worked across cultures, I’ve experienced how important stability, 
            compassion, and strong support systems are—especially for children. When rising costs and 
            limited childcare made it clear that staying in New York was no longer sustainable, 
            I chose to start fresh somewhere that allowed room to grow, breathe and build a wonderful community.
          </p>

          <p>
            This micro-school was born from that vision. 
            I wanted to create a place where children are known, 
            supported, and encouraged to learn at their own pace—where 
            education is personal, practical, and rooted in real life. 
            Our school values curiosity, kindness, independence, and connection. 
            Here, students aren’t just taught—they’re nurtured, challenged, 
            and celebrated as individuals. I am grateful to be part of this 
            community and honored to build a learning environment that feels safe, 
            thoughtful, and full of possibility for our children and our families.

          About Our Micro-School
        </h3>

        <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Epitome Education is a thoughtfully designed micro-school focused on small class sizes,
          meaningful relationships, and individualized learning experiences.
    
          Here at Epitome Home Education, we strive to make the  most enriching 
          and thoughtful educational experience for both parents and children. 
          We are very small so every child is treated with the utmost dignity and 
          allowed as much nurturing and attention that he or she needs to ensure their success. 
          As a mother, I want to provide the very best for my child and I have 
          not been able to find that standard of care, which is exactly why I founded this school. 
          Here, mothers will have the support and resources they need to provide 
          their child with a fulfilling education and the peace of mind that their 
          child’s wellbeing is the utmost priority. I will care for the children 
          who attend this school as if they were my own without exception. 
          Every bump will be nurtured, every meal will be home cooked, every 
          lesson enriching, fulfilling and kind. It is the comfort of home with the structure of school. 
          The information set forth in this handbook is just to allow for clarity 
          and alignment concerning the children we both care so much about.
        </p>

        <div id="schoolMore" class="expand leading-relaxed space-y-4">
          <p>
            As a student here at Epitome your child will have access to so many resources and the best 
            part about homeschooling with Epitome is that your child has peers and community and still 
            maintains the intimate environment of home. We have a computer lab with 6 chromebooks, 
            a brand new, state of the art playground, a fire-pit with beautiful comfortable lounging 
            furniture, an outdoor grilling area, a full chef’s kitchen and prepared meals daily, a fully 
            furnished library, music lessons and so much more. We will host book fairs, a school store, 
            meal prep for families on the go, “long weekend”, holiday and birthday events, parents night 
            out with huge bounce houses and so much more. 
          </p>

          <p>
            As students journey into their teen years, they have their own place at the center where 
            they are able to conduct research, attend online classes, meet up with friends in a safe 
            nurturing environment and have a meal, there are cooking classes, wood-working and other 
            skill building classes for them to explore and staff at the center is available to assist 
            with resources, questions and any other assistance they may need. They will also have access 
            to the computer labs (outside designated elementary student user times).  The students and 
            members here at Epitome will fondly remember their enriching educational experience for many 
            many years to come.
          </p>

          <p>
            We are delighted & fortunate to care for the families in our community and bring the homeschooled 
            children together so they are able to have that sense of community and still be taught with the 
            standards and values of their own parents. We respectfully ask that you do your absolute best to 
            fully comply with all of the standards described within this booklet in order to make the best 
            possible experience we can for all of the patrons at the center.
