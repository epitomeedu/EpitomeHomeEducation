      About Our Founder
    </h3>

    <!-- ALWAYS VISIBLE TEXT -->
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
      A grateful mother of 2 wonderful individuals; a man, aged 24 years and a high spirited,
      curious, 6 year old boy. I am a lifetime student having earned degrees from several
      accredited NY State Institutions such as Syracuse University and State University of
      New York @ Stony Brook.
    </p>

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Forever a student first, I am an educator at heart, and have longed for decades to put
      into place a micro-school that treats each child as an individual with a localized purpose.
    </p>

    <!-- HIDDEN EXPANDED TEXT -->
    <div id="founderMore" class="expand leading-relaxed space-y-4">
      <p>
        Since my big son was small I have pined to be the teacher that allows these children
        FREEDOM from a system that does not serve them or their families. As a longtime
        entrepreneur who believes deeply in the power of small, intentional communities,
        I listened to God as He spoke to me about West Texas.
      </p>

      <p>
        After years as a chef, bakery owner and property manager, the list of interests never ends.
        I love to bake and cook obviously but I am an avid outdoors person, knitter, reader,
        seamstress, fashionista, woodworker, writer — the list will go on forever.
      </p>

      <p>
        Being an entrepreneur, I learned firsthand the value of creativity, discipline, and
        especially failing forward. Life has also taught me resilience. As a military widow
        and an expat who has lived and worked across cultures, I’ve experienced how important
        stability, compassion, and strong support systems are — especially for children.
      </p>

      <p>
        This micro-school was born from that vision. I wanted to create a place where children
        are known, supported, and encouraged to learn at their own pace — where education is
        personal, practical, and rooted in real life.

      About Our Micro-School
    </h3>

    <!-- ALWAYS VISIBLE TEXT -->
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Here at Epitome Home Education, we strive to make the safest and most enjoyable
      educational experience for both parents and children. We are very small so every
      child is treated with the utmost care and given all the attention that he or she
      needs to ensure their success.
    </p>

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
      As a mother, I want to provide the very best for my child and I have not been able
      to find that standard of care, which is exactly why I founded this school.
    </p>

    <!-- HIDDEN EXPANDED TEXT -->
    <div id="schoolMore" class="expand leading-relaxed space-y-4">
      <p>
        Here, mothers will have the support and resources they need to provide their child
        with a fulfilling education and the peace of mind that their child’s wellbeing is
        the utmost priority. I will care for the children who attend this school as if they
        were my own without exception.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every bump will be nurtured, every meal will be home cooked, every lesson enriching,
        fulfilling and kind. It is the comfort of home with the structure of school.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a student here at Epitome your child will have access to so many resources and
        the best part about homeschooling with Epitome is that your child has peers and
        community and still maintains the intimate environment of home.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have a computer lab with 6 chromebooks, a brand new, state of the art playground,
        a fire-pit with beautiful comfortable lounging furniture, an outdoor grilling area,
        a full chef’s kitchen and prepared meals daily, a fully furnished library, music
        lessons and so much more.
      </p>

      <p>
        As students journey into their teen years, they will have their own place at the
        center where they are able to conduct research, attend online classes, meet up with
        friends in a safe nurturing environment and have a meal.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are delighted and fortunate to care for the families in our community and bring
        homeschooled children together so they are able to have that sense of community
        while being taught with the standards and values of their own parents.
      </p>
