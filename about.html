          About Our Founder
        </h3>

        <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
          A grateful mother of 2 wonderful individuals; a man, aged 24 years and a high spirited, curious, 6 year old boy. 
          I am a lifetime student having earned degrees from several accredited NY State Institutions such as Syracuse University and State University of New York @ StonyBrook. 
          Forever a student first, I am an educator at heart, and have longed for decades to put into place a micro-school that treats each child as an individual with a localized purpose. 
          Since my big son was small I have pined to be the teacher that allows these children FREEDOM from a system that does not serve them or their families. 
          As a longtime entrepreneur who believes deeply in the power of small, intentional communities, I listened to God as He spoke to me about West Texas.  
          Originally from New York, our journey brought us here with one clear goal: to create a better, more balanced life for my child while building something meaningful for others.
        </p>

        <div id="founderMore" class="expand leading-relaxed space-y-4">
          <p>
            After years as a chef, bakery owner and property manager, the list of interests never ends. 
            I love to bake and cook obviously but I am an avid outdoors person, knitter, reader, seamstress, fashionista, 
            woodworker, writer the list will go on forever because there is nothing I don't love. 
            I am beyond thrilled to be able to teach Epitome students every single thing I know 
            and to learn alongside them in an interactive and mutually respective environment. 
            Being an entrepreneur, I learned firsthand the value of creativity, discipline, and, 
            especially, failing forward. Life has also taught me resilience. As a military widow and 
            an expat who has lived and worked across cultures, I’ve experienced how important stability, 
            compassion, and strong support systems are—especially for children. When rising costs and 
            limited childcare made it clear that staying in New York was no longer sustainable, 
            I chose to start fresh somewhere that allowed room to grow, breathe and build a wonderful community.

          </p>

          <p>
            This micro-school was born from that vision. 
            I wanted to create a place where children are known, 
            supported, and encouraged to learn at their own pace—where 
            education is personal, practical, and rooted in real life. 
            Our school values curiosity, kindness, independence, and connection. 
            Here, students aren’t just taught—they’re nurtured, challenged, 
            and celebrated as individuals. I am grateful to be part of this 
            community and honored to build a learning environment that feels safe, 
            thoughtful, and full of possibility for our children and our families.
